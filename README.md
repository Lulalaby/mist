# Mist

Mist is a Framework for building WordPress Themes - it's to be used by developers
who want to built custom Themes for WordPress with ease using an OOP API in both
frontend and backend.

The Framework can be used in any WordPress Theme including child themes, simply install it using composer as per installation notes below and start using the classes in your Theme to customize it with ease!

## Why a Framework on top of a Framework (WordPress)?

Because WordPress is only the foundation layer. See Mist as a Wrapper, a Toolkit-Set of classes to get repetetive tasks like post type creation or customizer settings done. It also provides a way to securely generate forms or post meta fields from code without much hassle. 

Mist also brings you more object oriented approaches to work with Post objects, Images and schema.org
